Sinister and mammoth in the sky
I squeeze sinning fears behind the virgin
Be luminous. The passion was good
All invisible behind the trees
I lick angry visions over the dream
Alass! The Knight is no more
Dark and heavy on the air
We feel heavy evil on the mud
God! The night keeps going
open-eyed hesitant
a long way from home
a phone ringing somewhere
Where in the end
the victim
turn aside
in a different light
